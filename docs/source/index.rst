Welcome to Easier68k's documentation!
=====================================

Easier68k is a Python-based assembler and simulator of the Motorola 68000
microprocessor. It is based `Prof. Charles Kelly's EASy68k <http://www.easy68k.com/>`_,
with the goal of adding better cross-platform support without the use of Wine
or emulation (among other features).

.. warning::
    Easier68k is still very incomplete, and does not yet have the same feature set of
    EASy68k implemented. As a result, it's not quite ready for any wide-spread use
    (although why are you writing 68k in the first place?).
    
`A sample use-case of Easier68k can be found at github.com/Chris-Johnston/Easier68k-SampleProject <https://github.com/Chris-Johnston/Easier68k-SampleProject>`_.

If you would like to contribute to Easier68k's development, refer to
`our Issue list on GitHub <https://github.com/Chris-Johnston/Easier68k/issues>`_
as well as `the contributing guide <https://github.com/Chris-Johnston/Easier68k/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.
